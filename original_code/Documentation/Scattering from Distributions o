   Scattering from Distributions of Particles   Mean Intensity   The mean intensity of light scattered from a collection of particles   distributed in size and/or refractive index can be easily computed, by   calculation of the scattering from the constituent particles.   PSphSc(m,x,P,I,ang) returns the scattered Light for a sphere, size X,   refractive index relative to medium M at angle ang. M & X are taken   from histograms m & x with probabilities P. Incident light has Stoke's   Vector I.                                                       [Return to Index]       This page designed by the author of the m-files, David Barnett
