                    Mie Scattering Toolbox                    The Mie Scattering Toolbox is a collection of                    functions for Matlab. They were developed to perform                    scattering calculations for a scanning nephelometer                    used in the David Barnett's PhD experiments. The                    basic functions compute the intensity of light                    scattered from a single homogeneous spherical                    particle. This basic model has been extended to allow                    for distributions of particles and polychromatic                    light. In addition to this a visualisation technique   [SphereSc]       has been developed for the plotting of scattering                    results.                    The necessary functions can be downloaded from here.                    Also available are m-files for statistical scattering                    results of particle distributions and of                    polychromatic sources and for scattering into finite                    sensors of non-zero size and around a cylindrical                    tube. Details of all these functions can be found in                    Barnett, D.M.
