% PSphSc	Stoke's vector of scattered light.%		PSphSc(m,x,P,I,ang) returns the scattered Light for%		a sphere, size X, refractive index relative to medium M%		at angle ang.  M & X are taken from histograms m & x with%		probabilities P.%		Incident light has Stoke's Vector I.% Written by and copyright%		Dave Barnett%		Optical Engineering Group%		Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering%		Loughborough University%		9th January 1999function S = PSphSc(m, x, P, I, ang)S = SphereSc(m,x,I,ang);for i = 1:length(P)   S(:,:,i) = S(:,:,i)*P(i);endS = sum(S,3);
