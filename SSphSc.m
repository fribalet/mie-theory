% SSphSc	Stoke's vector of scattered polychromatic light.%		SSphSc(m,a,w,P,I,ang) returns the scattered light for%		a sphere, radius a, refractive index relative to medium m%		(which should be scalar or a W-vector, if wavelength%		dependent) at angle ang.  The particle is illuminated%		by a source with wavelengths w of power P (both W-vectors).%		Incident light has Stoke's Vector I.% Written by and copyright%		Dave Barnett%		Optical Engineering Group%		Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering%		Loughborough University%		16th February 1999function S = PSphSc(m, a, W, P, I, ang)S = PSphSc(m, 2*pi*a./W, P, I, ang);
