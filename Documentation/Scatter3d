                     All Angle Scattering Graph                     The Scatter3d function plots a surface                     representation of the light scattered from a single                     spherical particle. The distance from the origin of                     the surface is proportional to the logarithm of the                     intensity of light scattered in that direction.                     This function is useful for displaying the                     complexity of the light scattering phenomenon and                     the development of features as particle size                     changes.                     This function requires the intensity function.                     SphereSc(m,x,N) plots the intensity graph of a                     single spherical particle of refractive index                     relative to the background medium, m, and particle                     size parameter, x. Resolution of the surface is N   [Scatter3d]       points over 180¡.                     The refractive index is that relative to the                     background medium,                                                np                                           m =  --                                                nm                     where np is the particle refractive index and nm is                     the refractive index of the background medium.                     The particle size parameter is given by,                                                  2pa                                        x = ka =  ---                                                   l                     where k is the wavenumber in the background medium,                     a is the radius of the particle and l is the                     wavlength of the incident light in the medium.                                                       [Return to Index]       Scatter3d.m       function Scatter3d(m,x,N)       % SCATTER3d     Plots scattering as 3d surface       %               Scatter3d(m,x,N) plots a three dimensional       %               surface such that its distance from the origin       %               in a given direction is proportional to the       %               logarithm of the intensity of light scattered       %               in that direction by a particle with size and       %               refractive index parametes x and m.       %       %               N is the resolution of the surface.       %       %               Colour represents distance from the origin.       % Written by and copyright       %               Dave Barnett       %               Optical Engineering Group       %               Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering       %               Loughborough University       %               15th January 1999       if nargin <3             N = 180;  % default resolution is 1 deg.       end       % Generate scattering data for each quarter.       theta = (0:1:N)*pi/N;       phi = (0:2:N)'*pi/(2*N);       R = ones(length(phi), length(theta));       for i=1:length(phi)          I = [1; cos(2*phi(i)); sin(2*phi(i)); 0];          S = SphereSc(m,x,I,theta);          R(i,:) = log10(S(1,:));       end       R = R-min(min(R));       PHI = phi*ones(1,length(theta));       THETA = ones(length(phi),1)*theta;       % Flip quarters over into sphere       X = R.*cos(THETA);       A = R.*sin(THETA);       Y = A.*cos(PHI);       Z = A.*sin(PHI);       X = [X;flipud(X)];       Y = [Y;flipud(-Y)];       Z = [Z;flipud(Z)];       R = [R;flipud(R)];       X = [X,fliplr(X)];       Y = [Y,fliplr(Y)];       Z = [Z,fliplr(-Z)];       R = [R,fliplr(R)];       % Plot surface       surf(X,Y,Z,R)       shading flat       axis equal       axis off       light('Position',[0 -2 1]);       view([-20 50])This page designed by the author of the m-files, David Barnett
