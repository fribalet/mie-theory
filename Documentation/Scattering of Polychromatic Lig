   Scattering of Polychromatic Light   Mean Intensity   A particle illuminated by a polychromatic source will scatter the   varying wavelengths of light differently. The intensity measured by a   detector will be be the sum of these scattered waves. Any sensor will   modulate the result according to its own wavelength dependent   responsivity and so the distribution of wavelength passed to this   function should be distribution of wavelength as measured by the   sensor.   SSphSc(m,a,w,P,I,ang) returns the scattered light for a sphere, radius   a, refractive index relative to medium m (which should be scalar or a   W-vector, if wavelength dependent) at angle ang. The particle is   illuminated by a source with wavelengths w of power P (both   W-vectors). Incident light has Stoke's Vector I.                                                       [Return to Index]       This page designed by the author of the m-files, David Barnett
